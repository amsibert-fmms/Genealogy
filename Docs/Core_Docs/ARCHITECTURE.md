# 🏗️ GeneaX Architecture

## Overview
**GeneaX** is a modular Django-based application structured around the **GEDCOM X specification** for genealogical data.  

The architecture prioritizes:
- **Data integrity** – strict adherence to GEDCOM X entities.  
- **Extensibility** – easily add new data types or validation rules.  
- **Transparency** – traceable, verifiable genealogical assertions.  
- **Educational clarity** – intentionally written for learning Django deeply.

## ⚙️ Data Flow

**1. Input Layer**  
- Data can be entered manually via Django admin or imported as GEDCOM X JSON-LD.  
- Import pipeline validates data against the GEDCOM X schema and custom GeneaX rules.  

**2. Core Processing**  
- Validated entities are stored in the PostgreSQL database.  
- The `proof` app applies confidence scoring and creates ProofStatements.  
- Any conflicts or low-confidence claims are automatically flagged.  

**3. API Layer**  
- The REST API (Django REST Framework) exposes entities for external integration.  
- Supports CRUD operations, pagination, and filtering.  
- API responses are fully JSON-LD compliant.  

**4. Output Layer**  
- Export tools generate GEDCOM X JSON-LD or GeneaX proof bundles.  
- Visualization endpoints feed tree and timeline components in the UI.

**5. Relationship Resolution**
- The relationships module links Person entities across sources using extended relationship types and FamilyAppearance records. This allows complex multi-source mappings such as cousin marriages, in-law references, and cross-book property transactions to be modeled without duplication.

## 🧱 Core Components
|Component | Description |
|-----:|-----------------|
| **core/**	| Foundational utilities, base models, and shared mixins. |
| **gedcomx/**	| Implements primary GEDCOM X entities and relationships. |
| **proof/** | Contains the GeneaX Proof Standard implementation. |
| **api/** | REST API endpoints, serializers, and viewsets. |
| **import_export/** | Schema validation and GEDCOM X import/export logic. |
| **ui/** | Templates, static assets, and CSS/Tailwind theming. |
| **relationships/** |	Extended GEDCOM X relationships, cross-references, and contextual family appearances. |

## 🗃️ Database Design Summary
- **Backend:** PostgreSQL
- **Schema:** Normalized tables with JSON fields for flexible genealogical structures.
- **Primary Keys:** UUIDs to align with GEDCOM X resource identifiers.
- **Major Entities:**
    - Person
    - Relationship
    - FamilyAppearance
    - Event
    - Fact
    - SourceDescription
    - CrossReference
    - ProofStatement
    - Document
    - PlaceDescription

## 🔗 Interoperability
GeneaX aligns with GEDCOM X’s **data model** and **JSON-LD serialization** principles:
- Each entity maps to a corresponding GEDCOM X type.
- Imports and exports are schema-validated against the GEDCOM X JSON-LD spec.
- Extensible conversion layer for legacy GEDCOM 5.5.1 compatibility.
- Custom relationship types use project-scoped JSON-LD URIs (e.g., https://geneax.org/vocab#OfficiantPerformer) to preserve full GEDCOM X compliance while allowing culturally specific relational data, such as Amish community marriage officiants or interfamily property transfers.

## 🧠 Design Principles
**1. Transparency over convenience.**
- Every relationship or assertion must trace back to a source or ProofStatement.
     
**2. Layered modularity.**
- Each Django app performs a single, clearly defined role.
     
**3. Human-legible logic.**
- Readable code > clever code. Future-you deserves mercy.
     
**4. Loose coupling, strict validation.**
- Apps can evolve independently, but all data must pass compliance checks.

## 🚀 Future Extensions
- GraphQL API for advanced querying.
- Family tree and timeline visualization APIs.
- Collaboration features (shared editing, user permissions).
- Provenance tracking for versioned historical records.
