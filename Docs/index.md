# 🧬 GeneaX Documentation Index  
*Updated with chapter-based structure & cross-references*

Welcome to **GeneaX**, a Django-based genealogy platform built for hands-on learning and strict GEDCOM X alignment.  
This index lists all project documentation files — so you can pretend there’s order in the chaos.

For a **conceptual map of how everything fits together**, see:  
👉 **[`MasterOutline.md`](MasterOutline.md)** — Chapters, tiers, and cross-document relationships.
